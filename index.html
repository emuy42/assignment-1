                <p class="intro">
					In September, an impassioned panel of faculty at colleges and universities in New York testified for hours on the value of a humanities education in response to what they called mounting attacks on the discipline. 
                </p>
                <p class="intro">
					“We’re not loud enough,” said Lehman professor Karin Beck, whose piece <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/opinion/views/2023/06/14/humanities-arent-hurting-everywhere-opinion" target="_blank">The Humanities Aren’t Hurting Everywhere</a> prompted the hearing. “We have to speak up so they can’t pretend they didn’t hear us.” 
                </p>
				<p class="intro">
					Between 2012 and 2021, undergraduate enrollment in the humanities in the US declined by as much as 30 percent by some measures. Meanwhile, the number of students flocking to career-oriented fields has dramatically increased since 2000: business (60 percent), engineering (100 percent) and health-related majors (200 percent). The American Academy of Arts & Sciences, the organization that published this data, connects the decline in humanities enrollment to periods of economic anxiety, such as the 2008 recession or the outbreak of COVID-19. 
				</p>
				<p class="intro">
					The perception that graduates with humanities degrees struggle to find gainful employment has direct implications for the availability of humanities courses on US campuses. In March 2021, a Florida state senator <a href= "https://mynews13.com/fl/orlando/education/2021/03/02/senate-bill-86-would-require-college-students-to-select-major-that-leads-directly-to-employment" target="_blank">introduced a bill</a> that would tie students’ financial aid to the employability of their majors. In September 2023, West Virginia University eliminated 28 majors, effectively gutting the school’s liberal-arts program, to address a $45m budget shortfall.

                <p class="intro">
					In response, the National Humanities Alliance conducts research to demonstrate the value of the discipline. They find that humanities graduates are:

					<figcaption class="graphic-text">
						American employers seek candidates with skills that are cultivated in humanities programs. A large majority of hiring managers surveyed in 2018 said it was "very important" that recent graduates had the following skills: verbal communication (90 percent), critical thinking and analytic reasoning (84 percent), ability to work well on diverse teams (87 percent), ethical decision-making (87 percent), writing (78 percent),  complex problem solving (75 percent). A 2017 study done by Google found that similar 'soft' skills were among the most important qualities of its top employees.

					<h3>Employed</h3>
					<!-- <h5>Successfully and Gainfully</h5> -->
					<figcaption class="graphic-text">
						Graduates with humanities degrees have success finding work, despite common misperceptions otherwise. Humanities majors are slightly less unemployed than their peers: 2.13 percent of humanities majors were unemployed in 2018, compared to an average of 2.17 percent for all majors. They also work across a spectrum of occupations, such as management (15.5 percent of graduates in 2018), sales (13.4 percent), and business and financial operations (9.6 percent). Further, according to the 2018 American Community Survey, humanities graduates earn similar wages to the average bachelor's degree holder.

                    <figcaption class="graphic-text">
						Humanities graduates may be better equipped than those from other majors to navigate a future in which tasks are increasingly automated. A 2017 Cisco and Oxford Economics study on AI predicted there would be a 38 percent increase in work that requires critical thinking and creative tasks by 2027. It predicted that workers with generalized skills would adapt best to this environment. In addition, a 2019 study by Payscale found that humanities degrees have a high level of 'transferability,' meaning graduates have a broad range of jobs. The humanities came in at number three, below only business majors and social science majors.
